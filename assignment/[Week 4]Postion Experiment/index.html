                    Neil Alden Armstrong was an American astronaut, engineer, and the first person to set foot on the
                    Moon during the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969. He made his famous statement, "That's one small
                    step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind," as he stepped onto the lunar surface.

                    Before his historic journey to the Moon, Armstrong was a pilot in the United States Navy and later a
                    test pilot. He joined NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) in 1962 and quickly
                    became one of the Gemini program astronauts.

                    After the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong became an international hero and received numerous awards and
                    honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He retired from NASA in 1971 and went on to
                    teach aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati.

                    Neil Armstrong's achievements and contributions to space exploration have left an indelible mark on
                    human history, symbolizing the spirit of exploration and the pursuit of knowledge beyond Earth.
