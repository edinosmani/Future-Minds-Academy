            <h2>The Siamese Cat</h2>

            <br>

            <article>
                <p>
                    The Siamese cat (Thai: ‡πÅ‡∏°‡∏ß‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢, Maeo Thai; ‡πÅ‡∏°‡∏ß‡∏™‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏°, Maeo Sayam) is one of the first distinctly
                    recognised breeds of Asian cat. Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of several varieties of
                    cats native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the original Siamese became one of the most
                    popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century.[1] The carefully refined, more
                    extreme-featured, modern-style Siamese is characterised by blue almond-shaped eyes; a triangular
                    head shape; large ears; an elongated, slender, and muscular body; and various forms of point
                    colouration. Other than colouration, the modern-style Siamese bears little resemblance to the
                    original stock, and the more moderate, traditional, or "old-style" Siamese, with a much rounder head
                    and body, has been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat. The International Cat
                    Association describes the modern Siamese as affectionate, social, intelligent, and playful into
                    adulthood, often enjoying a game of fetch.[2] Siamese tend to seek human interaction and also like
                    companionship from other cats.

                    The Siamese (sometimes in the traditional form) is among the foundation stock of several other
                    breeds developed by crossbreeding with other cats; some examples are the Oriental Shorthair and
                    Colorpoint Shorthair, developed to expand the range of coat patterns; the long-haired variant most
                    often dubbed the Himalayan; and hair-mutation breeds, including the Cornish Rex, Sphynx, Peterbald,
                    and blue-point Siamese cat. The Siamese cat comes in two distinct variations: traditional, with a
                    rounded head (though not as rounded as the later American Apple-head mix) and a slightly chubby
                    body; or the modern Siamese, which is very skinny and has a wedge-shaped head. The long-haired
                    Siamese is recognised internationally as a Balinese cat. Siamese cats are one of the more common
                    breeds to have non-white irises.

            <h2>The British Shortghair Cat</h2>

            <article>
                <p>
                    The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a
                    distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the
                    "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has
                    also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.

                    It is one of the most ancient cat breeds known. In modern times, it remains the most popular
                    pedigreed breed in its native country, as registered by the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy
                    (GCCF). A quarter of all kittens registered with the GCCF each year are British Shorthairs, making
                    the British the most popular pedigree cat in the UK.[1]

                    The breed's good-natured appearance and relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star,
                    notably as the inspiration for John Tenniel's famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in
                    Wonderland. The Cat Fanciers' Association profile reads: "When gracelessness is observed, the
                    British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile'."[2]

            <h2>The Birman Cat</h2>

            <article>
                <p>
                    The Birman, also called the "Sacred Cat of Burma",[1] is a domestic cat breed. The Birman is a
                    long-haired, colour-pointed cat distinguished by a silky coat, deep blue eyes, and contrasting white
                    "gloves" on each paw.

                    The breed name is derived from Birmanie, the French form of Burma. The Birman breed was first
                    recognized in France by the Cat Club de France in 1925, then in England by the Governing Council of
                    the Cat Fancy[2] (GCCF) in 1966 and in United States by the Cat Fanciers' Association[1] (CFA) in
                    1967. It is also recognized by the Canadian Cat Association (CCA) and the International Cat
                    Association[3] (TICA) in 1979.
