                    Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fub'bɔl 'klub bəɾsə'lonə] ⓘ), commonly referred to as
                    Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça (['baɾsə]), is a professional football club based in
                    Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.

                    Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper,
                    the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club"
                    ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It
                    is the third-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth
                    richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.[2][3] The
                    official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria
                    Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed
                    Blaugrana.

                    Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de
                    España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder
                    for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and
                    worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint
                    record five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups,
                    and three FIFA Club World Cups.[5][6][7] Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation
                    of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and
                    occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023.[8][9][10] The club has a
                    long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El
                    Clásico.

                    Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the
                    largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[11][12] Barcelona players have won a
                    record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record seven
                    FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and
                    Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés
                    Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards,
                    an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.[13][14] Additionally, players
                    representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.[15]

                    Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated
                    from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real
                    Madrid.[16][17] In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble
                    consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first
                    Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the
                    Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.[18] In 2011, the club became European
                    champions again, winning five trophies.[19] This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just
                    four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all
                    time.[20][21][22] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique,
                    Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble
                    twice.[23]
