            <article>
                <b>Lionel Messi</b> is an <i>Argentine </i>professional soccer (football) player widely regarded as one
                of the
                greatest footballers of all time. He was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. Messi is known
                for his incredible skill, agility, and goal-scoring prowess.
                He spent the majority of his professional career at <i>FC Barcelona</i>, where he became an iconic
                figure and
                won numerous domestic and international titles, including multiple UEFA Champions League and La Liga
                titles. During his time at Barcelona, <b>Messi </b> set numerous records and received numerous
                individual
                awards, including multiple FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, which are given annually to the world's best player.
                In August 2021, <b>Messi </b> left <i>Barcelona</i> and joined <i>Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) </i> on a
                free transfer. He has
                also been a key player for the Argentine national team, helping them win the Copa America in 2021, which
                was a significant achievement for both Messi and his country.
                It's worth noting that my knowledge is up-to-date only until January 2022, so if there have been any
                major developments or events involving Lionel Messi after that date, I would not be aware of them.
