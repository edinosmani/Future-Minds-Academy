                    The Siamese cat (Thai: แมวไทย, Maeo Thai; แมวสยาม, Maeo Sayam) is one of the first distinctly
                    recognised

                    breeds of Asian cat. Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of several varieties of
                    cats native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the original Siamese became one of the most
                    popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century.[1] The carefully refined, more

                    extreme-featured, modern-style Siamese is characterised by blue almond-shaped eyes; a
                    triangular
                    head shape; large ears; an elongated, slender, and muscular body; and various forms of point
                    colouration. Other than colouration, the modern-style Siamese bears little resemblance to the
                    original stock, and the more moderate, traditional, or "old-style" Siamese, with a much rounder head
                    and body, has been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat. The International Cat
                    Association describes the modern Siamese as affectionate, social, intelligent, and playful into
                    adulthood, often enjoying a game of fetch.[2] Siamese tend to seek human interaction and also like
                    companionship from other cats.

                    The Siamese (sometimes in the traditional form) is among the foundation stock of several other
                    breeds developed by crossbreeding with other cats; some examples are the Oriental Shorthair and
                    Colorpoint Shorthair, developed to expand the range of coat patterns; the long-haired variant most
                    often dubbed the Himalayan; and hair-mutation breeds, including the Cornish Rex, Sphynx, Peterbald,
                    and blue-point Siamese cat. The Siamese cat comes in two distinct variations: traditional, with a
                    rounded head (though not as rounded as the later American Apple-head mix) and a slightly chubby
                    body; or the modern Siamese, which is very skinny and has a wedge-shaped head. The long-haired
                    Siamese is recognised internationally as a Balinese cat. Siamese cats are one of the more common
                    breeds to have non-white irises.

                    History
                    A description and depiction of the Wichienmaat (Siamese cat) first appears in a collection of
                    ancient manuscripts called the Tamra Maew (The Cat-Book Poems), thought to originate from the
                    Ayutthaya Kingdom (1351 to 1767 AD). Over a dozen are now kept in the National Library of Thailand,
                    while others have resurfaced outside of Thailand and are now in the British Library and National
                    Library of Australia. In addition to the old Siamese cat, the Tamra Maew also describes other
                    heritage cats of Thailand including the Korat cat (Malet), which is still bred for preservation in
                    Thailand today and has become popular in other countries, and the Konja cat (Black cat), Suphalak (a
                    controversy in Burmese cat).

                    When the capital city Ayutthaya was sacked on 7 April 1767 at the end of the Burmese–Siamese war,
                    the Burmese army burned everything in sight. It returned to Burma, taking Siamese noblemen and royal
                    family members with them as captives. Buddha images were hacked apart for their gold, and all the
                    royal treasures were stolen. A Thai legend has it that the King of Burma Hsinbyushin found and read
                    the poem for the Thai cats in the Tamra Maew. The poem describes Thai cats as being as rare as gold,
                    and anyone who owns this cat will become wealthy. He told his army to round up all the Suphalak cats
                    and bring them back to Burma along with the other treasures. Today in Thailand, this legend is told
                    as a humorous explanation of the rarity of Thai cats.

                    Siamese
                    Siamese cats are one of the most popular breeds of cats in the world. They are known for their
                    distinctive pointed features, including their almond-shaped blue eyes, triangular ears, and long,
                    slender bodies. Siamese cats are also known for their intelligence, playfulness, and affectionate
                    personalities.[3] The pointed cat known in the West as "Siamese", recognized for its distinctive
                    markings, is one of several breeds of cats from Siam described and illustrated in manuscripts called
                    "Tamra Maew" (Cat Poems), estimated to have been written from the 14th to the 18th century.[4] In
                    1878, U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes received the first documented Siamese to reach the United
                    States, a cat named "Siam" sent by the American Consul in Bangkok.[5] In 1884, the British
                    Consul-General in Bangkok, Edward Blencowe Gould (1847–1916),[6] brought a breeding pair of the
                    cats, Pho and Mia, back to Britain as a gift for his sister, Lilian Jane Gould (who, married in 1895
                    as Lilian Jane Veley,[7] went on to co-found the Siamese Cat Club in 1901). In 1885, Gould's UK cats
                    Pho and Mia produced three Siamese kittens—Duen Ngai, Kalohom, and Khromata—who were shown with
                    their parents that same year at London's Crystal Palace Show. Their unique appearance and distinct
                    behaviour attracted attention, but all three of the kittens died soon after the show, their cause of
                    death not documented.[8]

                    By 1886, another pair (with kittens) was imported to the UK by Eva Forestier Walker (surnamed Vyvyan
                    after 1887 marriage)[9] and her sister, Ada. Compared to the British Shorthair and Persian cats that
                    were familiar to most Britons, these Siamese imports were longer and less "cobby" in body types, had
                    heads that were less rounded with wedge-shaped muzzles and had larger ears. These differences and
                    the pointed coat pattern, which had not been seen before in cats by Westerners, produced a strong
                    impression—one early viewer described them as "an unnatural nightmare of a cat." Over the next
                    several years, fanciers imported a small number of cats, forming the base breeding pool for the
                    entire breed in Britain. It is believed that most Siamese in Britain today are descended from about
                    eleven of these original imports. In their early days in Britain, they were called the "Royal Cat of
                    Siam", reflecting reports that they had previously been kept only by Siamese royalty.[10] Later
                    research has not shown evidence of any organised royal breeding programme in Siam.[4] The original
                    Siamese imports were medium-sized, rather long-bodied, muscular, graceful cats with moderately
                    wedge-shaped heads and ears that were comparatively large but in proportion to the size of the head.
                    The cats ranged from substantial to slender but were not extreme either.
